The first comment on this page is the information that WordPress looks for
to identify this as a plugin. Leave it be for now, other than updating the
version number as we progress.

This comment can be ditched when we start coding.

To do list:
-----------
* Check if Client Dash is active. If not, display a notice informing
the user that it is required.
* Check if Woocommerce is active. If not, display a notice informing
the user that it is required.
* Add a new tab on the Reports page. We could call it 'Sales', 'Store', 
'Woocommerce', 'Ecommerce' or something like that.
* Retrieve the data from Woocommerce (we can discuss what data would be nice)
* Start displaying the data
